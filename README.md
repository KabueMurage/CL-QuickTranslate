## About

  <summary> 《Why ? what and when? 》</summary>
  
  *As present, The Web version of Google Translate opens with standard European language pairs by default 
(none of which I EVER use)
yet nowhere in the Google menu is there the possibility to set default languages for translation, neither 
are the last used pairs synced to my account, which leaves me with the boring options to navigate the
languages from the drop-down menu or bookmark their syntax appended url for quick and future use. 
And as a frequent user Itd be very annoying to keep changing them, which led me to a quicker approach to provide
a one liner solution to it.*

The ```-l``` switch supports the full language iso name or the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) prefix


### Example using a string ``-s``:
> ```CL-translate.exe -s 'hello world' -l 'german'```

 ### **Example using a file ```-f```:**
> ```CL-translate.exe -f "Noche Oscura.txt" -l English```
